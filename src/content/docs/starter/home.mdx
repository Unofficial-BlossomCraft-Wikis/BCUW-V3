title: We're migrating to WikiDot
description: We're migrating to WikiDot, heres why, what to expect, and some more information! | Unofficial BlossomCraft Wiki

## Why are we migrating?
Truthfully, the deployment time of the website is reaching the 5-7 minute range, which is quite lengthy.

## What is WikiDot?
[WikiDot (wikidot.com)](https://wikidot.com) is a [wiki farm](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki_farm) that, unlike other wiki farms (like fandom), does not contain a ton of ads, the platform does still serve ads to users who are not signed in, but they are, as wiki dot says, placed in unintrusive spots.

WikiDot is also the wiki farm home to the [SCP wiki](https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/). This fact shows that the platform can handle a large number of pages, and given that, as of writing, we have 7 crates making close to 200 (EDIT, as of a recent git commit made on 12/18/2023 that updated every page, there are 116 files, 2 where back end files, so there are 114 pages, still a metric ton of pages) files so the ability to handle a load of files is nessasary.

## Why WikiDot?
WikiDot, as stated before, does not contain tons of ads like Fandom, it also alows for more consomizability without having to keep up the website code.

## What will change?
Layout, that's mostly it, there will also be changes in the URL however, the URL `blossomcraft.dovahkiin.xyz` will be redirecting to `unofficialblossomcraftwiki.wikidot.com`, this is to make sure there will be no caching issues.

## Will there be anything new?
YES! Not only the layout, but with the change, it is planned to start making the wiki more general purpose.

the orginization will become alot like the [SCP wiki](https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/)'s.

## When will this be happening?
It is planned for the Wikidot page to launch on New Year's Day, during this time, the only crate that will be added will be the christmas crate, if one launces this year.

you may view the progress on the WikiDot page here: [unofficialblossomcraftwiki.wikidot.com](https://unofficialblossomcraftwiki.wikidot.com).

## What will happen to this site?
It will be kept up, infact it will be updated a day or two after the WikiDot, as all new pages will be added though github pull requests here, then before the pull request is merged with this website's code, the reviewer will have to add the pages to the WikiDot. This will happen until at least New Year's Day of 2025.

## Notes from Altie
Although the platform the site is currently running on is amazing, the speed is the main factor here, I will also try to make this a smooth transition.

Have a good day/night!

## Update from Altie
After the Christmas crate, I will no longer be updating this site, please start using the [wikidot site](https://unofficialblossomcraftwiki.wikidot.com).
