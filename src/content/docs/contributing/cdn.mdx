We have a Content Delivery Network (CDN) that we use to host our static assets. This is open to the public for anyone to access.

to access, use this format:

```
https://cdn.bcuw.xyz/2D/<crate>/<file>.<ext>
```

To see all files go to this github repo: https://github.com/Unofficial-BlossomCraft-Wikis/BCUW-CDN

Please double check the path as some files may have extra folders they are contained in.

:::caution
3D files have be moved to `/deprecated/3D/` folder on 7/14/2024. \
This is due to BlossomCraft no longer having their texture pack for download, so we can't get new 3d models. \
with this 3D will not be updated with old items.
